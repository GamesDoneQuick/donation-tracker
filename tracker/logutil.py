    A class to collect logs that will be reported later.

    It can be useful, for example, when you need to add log entries
    in forms (e.g. in a custom admin page) without the need to pass a
    request argument::

        class MyForm(forms.Form):
            def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
                super(MyForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

            def save(self):
                ... add some instance
                self.collector.added(instance)

    If you have a formset of forms like the above, it is easy to
    collect all logs::

        class MyBaseFormSet(BaseFormSet):
            def save(self):
                collectors = []
                for form in self.forms:

                    collectors.append(form.collector)
                # collect changes for all forms
                self.collector = sum(collectors, AdminLogCollector())
                # return the number of forms that did something
                return len(filter(None, collectors))

    In the view you can actually save all collected log entries::
